# Logistic Regression Assignment

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a simple implementation of logistic regression using Python. The notebook walks through the steps of loading data, preprocessing, training a logistic regression model, and visualizing the results. Alongside the Jupyter Notebook, there is also a corresponding .py python file.
The Logistic Regression folder contains the following files:
- A .ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook) that contains all the code regarding the assignment including text blocks explaining portions of the code
- A corresponding .py file
- seven .png files that are screenshots of the plots in the Jupyter Notebook
- a star_classification.csv file that contains the raw data for the Logistic Regression part of the assignment
- an auto_mpg.csv file that contains the raw data for the Ridge Regression part of the assignmenton. You can download and save the .csv files in your computer and open them as Excel files for better readability.

## Introduction

Linear regression is a fundamental machine-learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This assignment provides a clear and concise example of how to implement linear regression from scratch using Python.
## Installation Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
 pip install numpy
```
```bash
 pip install pandas
```

## Project Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

Introduction: Overview of the project and linear regression.
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Steps to load and preprocess the dataset.
Model Training: Training the linear regression model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model performance.
Visualization: Plotting the results to visualize the model performance.


## Data

The dataset used in this notebook is a .csv file.  
- The `temperatures.csv` dataset is designed for bias correction of next-day maximum and minimum air temperature forecasts produced by the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration. <br> <br>

Dataset Summary:
- **Feature Type:** Real
- **Instances:** 7586
- **Input Features:** 21 (including present-day temperature data, LDAPS model forecasts, and geographical information)
- **Output:** Next-day maximum (Next_Tmax)


## Training and Visualization

The entire training process alongside the maths involved is explained in detail in the jupyter notebook. 
- Note: A good knowledge of Calculus is required to fully understand the gradient descent algorithm, especially the concept of partial derivatives.


## Lessons

A linear regression project can teach a variety of valuable skills and concepts, including:

- Data Preprocessing: How to clean and prepare data for analysis, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

- Feature Selection: Identifying which features (variables) are most important for making predictions and how to choose them effectively.

- Model Building: Understanding how to build a linear regression model, including splitting data into training and testing sets, fitting the model, and making predictions.

- Performance Evaluation: Using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of your model and understand its accuracy.

- Interpreting Results: Understanding the coefficients of the linear regression model and what they signify in terms of the relationships between variables.

- Visualization: Using visualization tools to plot data, visualize the regression line, and understand the relationship between variables.

- Algorithm Implementation: Learning about the underlying algorithm used in linear regression and how it optimizes the line of best fit.
